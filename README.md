## Overview
This is a simple TypeScript REST API I made as my first TypeScript project and also rewriting my previous REST API written in JavaScript to TypeScript.
My JavaScript REST API: https://github.com/Yukii2k/Simple-RESTful-API 

Enter your MongoDB connection string inside the `.env-sample` file and rename it to `.env` to set is as the environment variables.

```shell
MONGO_URI = ENTER YOUR  MONGODB CONNECTION STRING HERE
```
